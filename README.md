Machine Learning Experiments on Standard Datasets.

This repo will contain a series of [notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) for experiments on well known datasets used in machine learning.  [Keras](https://keras.io/)/[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) will be used for Neural Networks and [ski-kit learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) for other approaches.  

* `MNIST -             99.49 % - CNN`
* `StackOverflowData - 81.83 % - SVC`
